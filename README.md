# MyUCF-2.0
In April 2023, I competed in the UCF Knight Hacks Hackaday 2.0 event with three other teammates. Our mission was to formulate and present the design of an application that could better student life at UCF to a panel of judges. After around 12 hours of work and a very memorable presentation, our application placed among the three winners of Hackaday 2.0.

## So, what exactly is MyUCF 2.0?
Well, if you are a student at UCF you probably have the unfortunate opportunity to use MyUCF. To keep the rant brief, let's just say MyUCF is a student portal that is slow, wordy, and overly unappealing to the eye. So when my team, The UCF Fixers and Repair Technician Squad, were prompted with the question: "Design something to improve student life or experience at UCF" we knew exactly what we had to do. And juat like that, the idea of MyUCF 2.0 was born. We spent hours designing the front end of MyUCF 2.0. We drew inspiration from Webcourses' front end (an application every UCF student uses) to improve MyUCF 2.0's design. We made sure to keep the necessary tools of any student portal like accessing grades, transcripts, major changes, advising, financials, etc. However, to consolidate the many, and I mean many, applications UCF students use we decided to add multiple API's to the homepage of MyUCF 2.0. Now instead of having to go to multiple different pages on a browser, you can refer to MyUCF 2.0 for your extracurricular information, student email, Webcourses, housing, and even Rate My Professors.

## What did I learn during this project?
A lot! I was able to gain some experience using Figma as that is the software we used to design the whole project. During Hackaday 2.0, I attended an HTML workshop and got to learn a bit more about utilizing HTML to design websites. Both of these technologies sparked my interest in front-end design and I hope to further use these in my career one day. Most importantly, I developed better teamwork skills during this Hackaday. We ran into some disagreements on designs but we were always able to compromise. Thus, creating a well-rounded final product. We also made sure to delegate tasks equally so all teammates could do their part and contribute their expertise. For example, I was in charge of the taskbar, email API, and academic status section. I believe all of this contributed greatly to our team's success and the development of each teammate. We all walked away with new skills and a $30 Amazon gift card!

## How can I see MyUCF2.0?
Unfortunately, it isn't a real application yet. However, our original designs are on this repository as a PDF, so feel free to go check it out!
